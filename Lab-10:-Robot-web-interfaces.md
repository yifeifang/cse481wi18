In this lab, we will see how to make web interfaces for controlling your robot.
For your projects, you may use whatever web programming framework you like.
But, these labs will use [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/).

# Robot Web Tools

# Robot web tools tutorials
Go to the [Robot Web Tools](http://robotwebtools.org/tools.html) website.
Notice that each of the three libraries, roslibjs, ros2djs, and ros3djs, have tutorials.
Tutorial 1 ([Writing an actionlib client](http://wiki.ros.org/roslibjs/Tutorials/ActionlibClient)) and Tutorial 3 ([Basic ROS functionality](http://wiki.ros.org/roslibjs/Tutorials/BasicRosFunctionality)) of the [roslibjs tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/roslibjs/Tutorials) will be especially helpful.

# Using other frameworks
You can use [Robot Web Tools](http://wiki.ros.org/roslibjs/Tutorials) to interface with ROS using other web programming frameworks.
As of Winter 2018, the Robot Web Tools project has had issues with its CDN not working, so please contact the course staff if you have problems.
